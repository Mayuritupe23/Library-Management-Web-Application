## Introduction
The Library Management Web Application is designed to streamline library operations. It helps the librarian manage book inventory, member information, and track book transactions such as issuing and returning books. The system calculates rent fees for issued books and handles fines for overdue books. The app includes functionality for importing book data via an API, allowing the librarian to add new books in bulk. The application is built using the Frappe Framework and provides a custom UI for handling CRUD operations and book management.

## Features
- **Book Management**: Perform CRUD operations on books, including adding new books, updating book details, and deleting books.
- **Member Management**: Add and manage library members, including tracking their outstanding debt.
- **Book Issuing**: Issue books to members with a return date and automatic rent fee calculation.
- **Book Returns**: Handle book returns, calculate fines for overdue books, and update member outstanding debt.
- **Book Search**: Search for books by title or author.
- **Import Books**: Import books into the system using an external API.
- **Automated Rent and Fine Calculation**: Rent fee is calculated per day for each book issued, and fines are calculated for overdue books.
- **Member Limit**: Ensure that a memberâ€™s outstanding debt does not exceed Rs. 500.
- **Custom UI**: A custom user interface built in Frappe's `www` folder to perform CRUD operations without relying on the default Frappe UI.
